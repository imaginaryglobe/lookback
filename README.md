# Media Search

A local AI describes every photo/video you own, and you search those descriptions in plain English.

Search your own photos and videos with plain-language queries — "birthday parties," "receipts from last year," "that hike we did in the fall" — instead of scrolling through folders. Everything runs on your own machine (or your own home network): your files are never uploaded anywhere, and no cloud AI service ever sees them.

> **Windows only.** The setup/launch scripts and the "open file" feature are Windows-specific.

## How it works

1. **Indexing** — the app walks a folder you choose and asks a local vision model ([Ollama](https://ollama.com)) to describe each photo/video.
2. Those descriptions are turned into embeddings and stored in [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech), a small local vector database.
3. **Searching** — your query is expanded into related terms, embedded the same way, and matched against everything indexed, so "things from the beach" can match a caption saying "sand, waves, sunset" even if you never typed those words.
4. Results show up as thumbnails with captions and a relevance score, right in your browser.

Nothing calls out to the internet during search or indexing.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)** — runs the AI models, on this computer or another one on your network
- **ffmpeg** — `winget install ffmpeg`
- **Git** (or just download the ZIP)

Docker and a separate database install are **not** required — Qdrant runs embedded, in-process.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone <this-repo-url>
   cd img-searcher
   ```
2. Pull the models Ollama will use:
   ```
   ollama pull moondream
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   ollama pull llama3.2
   ```
3. Run `run_all.bat`. The first time, it installs dependencies, walks you through a short setup wizard (which folder to index, where Ollama is running), and opens `http://localhost:8000`.
4. In the browser, go to **Index Status** and click **Index new files**. This is the slow part — it's resumable, so you can close and come back later.
5. Switch to **Search** and type what you're looking for.

Every run after the first just starts the app — setup only happens once.

## Choosing models for your hardware

The defaults (`moondream`, `nomic-embed-text`, `llama3.2`) run comfortably on ~8GB RAM. With more RAM/VRAM, upgrading the **vision model** (e.g. to `llava:7b` or `llava:13b`) matters most — it drives caption quality, which is what actually gets searched. Swap models by pulling the new one, updating `VISION_MODEL`/`QUERY_MODEL` in `.env`, and restarting — no need to re-run setup.

## Running Ollama on a separate machine

If your main computer is short on RAM, run Ollama on another machine on your network and point this app at it over SSH — the setup wizard handles this if you answer "another computer." Set up passwordless SSH first (`ssh-keygen` + `ssh-copy-id`); see `start_tunnel.bat` for exact commands.

## Configuration (`.env`)

`setup.py` writes this for you; hand-edit and restart the app anytime. See `.env.example` for the full template.

| Variable | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `HOST` / `PORT` | Where the web server listens (default `127.0.0.1:8000` — this machine only) |
| `SSD_PATH` | The folder that gets indexed |
| `OLLAMA_URL`, `OLLAMA_REMOTE` | Where Ollama is, and whether it's remote (SSH tunnel) |
| `VISION_MODEL`, `EMBED_MODEL`, `QUERY_MODEL` | Which Ollama models to use |
| `QDRANT_MODE` | `embedded` (default) or `server` (a separate Qdrant instance, e.g. via `docker-compose.yml`) |

## Running the tests

The project has a small pytest suite covering the security-sensitive and correctness-critical parts of the code (path-traversal protection, file dedup hashing):

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest tests/
```

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) runs this suite automatically on every push.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Cannot reach Ollama"** — make sure `ollama serve` is running (or check your SSH tunnel if remote).
- **Indexing is slow** — expected for large libraries; captioning is the bottleneck. Try a lighter vision model if needed.
- **A file shows "failed" status** — it's retried automatically on the next indexing run.
- **Search returns nothing** — check Index Status to confirm files have actually been indexed.

## Privacy

Search queries and image descriptions can include sensitive content — models, captions, and the database all stay on hardware you control. Nothing is sent to any third-party service.
